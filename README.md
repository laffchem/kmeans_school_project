# Install The Dependencies

Create a virtual environment - `python -m venv venv`

Install the dependencies - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Open up the .ipynb (note in vs code you'll just need to specify the interpreter, it'll ask or something and you'll have to install some kernel modules into it)

Run all the cells and you'll see the outputs as graphs.
